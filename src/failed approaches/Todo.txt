1. Calculate everything in Frenet coordinates:
	- own location, goal location, other cars

2. Set goals:
	- Goal: travel up to an point on the course as fast as possible (right lane)
	- compute possible goal loactions each decision-step
	- keep lane, prepare go left, prepare go right, go left, go right
	- use cost-functions to decide what actions to take
		--> no overtaking on right side
		--> as close to vmax as possible
		--> keep distance to car in front
		--> dont swerve into car on lane next to you
		--> if possible keep to right lane

3. Calculate possible trajectories to reach immidiate goal
	- calculate different trajectories for selected goal
	- use cost function to decide for best trajectory (using two trajectories? , s(t), d(t))
		--> minimizing jerk, a_max, a_min (both lateral and transversal)
		--> physical limitations (a_max, a_min)
			--> for total lateral a --> calculate xy postions
		--> minimum distance to cars		

	- select trajectory --> recalculate in xy
